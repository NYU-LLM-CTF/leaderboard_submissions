Given the constraints we're facing with this CTF challenge, I believe the best course of action is to move on and focus our efforts elsewhere.\n\nWithout access to the compiled binary, we're simply too limited in our ability to effectively analyze and exploit the vulnerabilities in the kernel module. Continuing to speculate and try to develop exploits without any way to validate them would be an inefficient use of our time.\n\nAt this point, I think the prudent decision is to acknowledge the boundaries of our current information and resources, and shift our attention to other CTF challenges where we can be more productive and successful.\n\nWhile it's disappointing to have to give up on this particular challenge, sometimes moving on is the wisest choice, especially when we lack crucial details or the means to properly test our ideas. Spinning our wheels here is unlikely to lead to a successful outcome.\n\nInstead, let's turn our focus to CTF challenges where we can leverage our skills and tools more effectively. Perhaps we'll encounter this kernel module vulnerability in a different context in the future, and then we can revisit it with a fresh perspective.\n\nFor now, I believe transitioning to a new challenge is the best way forward.
