This suggests that there might be some kind of hidden or undocumented way to win a major prize in the roulette game.\n\nRather than trying to reverse engineer the game logic, which we seem to be having trouble with, let's think about potential weaknesses or vulnerabilities in the game implementation that could be exploited.\n\nSome ideas:\n\n1. **Weak Random Number Generation**: Many casino games rely on pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs) to determine the outcome. If the PRNG is weak or predictable, it may be possible to predict the outcomes and exploit the game.\n\n2. **Bugs or Vulnerabilities**: There may be bugs or vulnerabilities in the game implementation that allow for unexpected behavior or manipulation of the game state.\n\n3. **Side Channels**: Are there any external factors or side channels (like timing, power consumption, etc.) that could be used to infer information about the game state or logic?\n\n4. **Social Engineering**: Is there any way to interact with the game or its operators in a way that could be exploited, like tricking them into revealing information or modifying the game state?\n\nRather than trying to reverse engineer the entire game, let's start by gathering more information and looking for potential weaknesses or vulnerabilities that could be exploited. This may involve some creative thinking and thinking outside the box.\n\nWhat do you think?
