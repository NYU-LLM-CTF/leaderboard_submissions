Let me take a step back and try to provide a high-level approach to solving this challenge:\n\n1. The challenge description mentions it is an \"intro to Neural Networks and Data Analysis\" challenge. This suggests the files in the `inputs.zip` archive likely contain data that needs to be analyzed and/or used to train a neural network model.\n\n2. The key steps I would take are:\n   - Unzip the `inputs.zip` archive and explore the contents of the `X.pkl`, `X_test.pkl`, and `y.pkl` files using Python.\n   - Determine the structure and format of the data in these files.\n   - Depending on the data, develop a plan to preprocess, analyze, and/or train a machine learning model on the data.\n   - Once a model is trained, use it to make predictions or extract insights that could lead to the flag.\n\n3. If I'm still unable to obtain the flag after exploring the data and developing a model, I would try to identify any other clues or hints in the challenge description or environment that could help guide the solution.\n\nDoes this high-level approach make sense?
