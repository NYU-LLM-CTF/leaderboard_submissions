Let's try a different approach.\n\nSince we have the `sandbox.py` file, let's focus on understanding the code in there. The key points I noticed are:\n\n1. The script uses a blacklist to prevent certain commands from being executed.\n2. It constructs a new command string by reading a specific line from the `sandbox.py` file, extracting a module name and a function name, and then using `getattr` and `__builtins__.__dict__` to execute the user's input.\n\nThis suggests that the challenge is likely to be solved by finding a way to bypass the blacklist and execute arbitrary Python code.
