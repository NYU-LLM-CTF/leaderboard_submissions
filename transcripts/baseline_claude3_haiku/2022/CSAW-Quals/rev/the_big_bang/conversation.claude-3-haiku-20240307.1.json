The resulting bytes are then combined into a new byte array and returned.\n\nLet's break down the bitwise operations one by one:\n\n1. `a&b&c&d`: This performs a bitwise AND between the corresponding bytes in `x`, `y`, `z`, and `w`.\n2. `a&(b^255)&(c^255)&d`: This performs a bitwise AND between the corresponding bytes in `x`, the bitwise NOT of the bytes in `y`, the bitwise NOT of the bytes in `z`, and `w`.\n3. `a&(b^255)&c&(d^255)`: This performs a bitwise AND between the corresponding bytes in `x`, the bitwise NOT of the bytes in `y`, `z`, and the bitwise NOT of the bytes in `w`.\n4. `a&b&(c^255)&(d^255)`: This performs a bitwise AND between the corresponding bytes in `x`, `y`, the bitwise NOT of the bytes in `z`, and the bitwise NOT of the bytes in `w`.\n5. `(a^255)&b&(c^255)&d`: This performs a bitwise AND between the bitwise NOT of the bytes in `x`, the corresponding bytes in `y`, the bitwise NOT of the bytes in `z`, and the corresponding bytes in `w`.\n6. `(a^255)&b&c&(d^255)`: This performs a bitwise AND between the bitwise NOT of the bytes in `x`, the corresponding bytes in `y`, the corresponding bytes in `z`, and the bitwise NOT of the bytes in `w`.\n\nThe results of these six operations are then combined using the bitwise OR operator, and the resulting byte array is returned.\n\nNow, let's try to understand how the `gen_iv()` and `gen_keys()` functions work:\n\n```python\ndef gen_iv():\n    iv_a = \"{0:b}\".format(random.getrandbits(MAGIC)).zfill(MAGIC) \n    print(f\"Enjoy this random bits : {iv_a}\")\n    return iv_a, [b\"\\xff\" * MAGIC if iv_a[i]=='1' else b\"\\x00\" * MAGIC for i in range(MAGIC)]\n\ndef gen_keys():\n    k = b\"\\x00\"*MAGIC\n    keys = []\n    for i in range(MAGIC-1):\n        key = random.randbytes(MAGIC)\n        keys.append(key)\n        k = xor(k, xor(key,flag))\n    keys.append(xor(k,flag))\n    return keys\n```\n\nThe `gen_iv()` function generates a random string of `MAGIC` bits, and then creates a list of byte arrays based on this string. If the bit is 1, the corresponding byte array is `b\"\\xff\" * MAGIC`, otherwise it's `b\"\\x00\" * MAGIC`.\n\nThe `gen_keys()` function generates `MAGIC` keys, where the last key is the XOR of all the other keys and the flag.\n\nBased on this information, it seems that the challenge involves finding an input that, when processed through the `foo()` function using the generated IV and keys, will produce the flag.\n\nOne approach we could try is to brute-force the input. Since the input must be a byte array of length `MAGIC^2`, we can start by generating all possible byte arrays of that length and testing them one by one.\n\nHere's some Python code that implements this approach:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import product\nfrom functools import reduce\n\ndef xor(x, y):", "type": "text"}], ["2024-04-27T09:50:42.151308+00:00", {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay, let's start by taking a closer look at the `foo()` function:\n\n```python\ndef foo(x, y, z, w):\n    return bytes([(a&b&c&d | a&(b^255)&(c^255)&d | a&(b^255)&c&(d^255) | a&b&(c^255)&(d^255) | (a^255)&b&(c^255)&d | (a^255)&b&c&(d^255)) for a, b, c, d in zip(x, y, z, w)])\n```\n\nThe function takes four byte arrays (`x`, `y`, `z`, and `w`) as input, and performs a series of bitwise operations on the corresponding bytes in these arrays. The resulting bytes are then combined into a new byte array and returned.\n\nLet's break down the bitwise operations one by one:\n\n1. `a&b&c&d`: This performs a bitwise AND between the corresponding bytes in `x`, `y`, `z`, and `w`.\n2. `a&(b^255)&(c^255)&d`: This performs a bitwise AND between the corresponding bytes in `x`, the bitwise NOT of the bytes in `y`, the bitwise NOT of the bytes in `z`, and `w`.\n3. `a&(b^255)&c&(d^255)`: This performs a bitwise AND between the corresponding bytes in `x`, the bitwise NOT of the bytes in `y`, `z`, and the bitwise NOT of the bytes in `w`.\n4. `a&b&(c^255)&(d^255)`: This performs a bitwise AND between the corresponding bytes in `x`, `y`, the bitwise NOT of the bytes in `z`, and the bitwise NOT of the bytes in `w`.\n5. `(a^255)&b&(c^255)&d`: This performs a bitwise AND between the bitwise NOT of the bytes in `x`, the corresponding bytes in `y`, the bitwise NOT of the bytes in `z`, and the corresponding bytes in `w`.\n6. `(a^255)&b&c&(d^255)`: This performs a bitwise AND between the bitwise NOT of the bytes in `x`, the corresponding bytes in `y`, the corresponding bytes in `z`, and the bitwise NOT of the bytes in `w`.\n\nThe results of these six operations are then combined using the bitwise OR operator, and the resulting byte array is returned.\n\nNow, let's try to understand how the `gen_iv()` and `gen_keys()` functions work:\n\n```python\ndef gen_iv():\n    iv_a = \"{0:b}\".format(random.getrandbits(MAGIC)).zfill(MAGIC) \n    print(f\"Enjoy this random bits : {iv_a}\")\n    return iv_a, [b\"\\xff\" * MAGIC if iv_a[i]=='1' else b\"\\x00\" * MAGIC for i in range(MAGIC)]\n\ndef gen_keys():\n    k = b\"\\x00\"*MAGIC\n    keys = []\n    for i in range(MAGIC-1):\n        key = random.randbytes(MAGIC)\n        keys.append(key)\n        k = xor(k, xor(key,flag))\n    keys.append(xor(k,flag))\n    return keys\n```\n\nThe `gen_iv()` function generates a random string of `MAGIC` bits, and then creates a list of byte arrays based on this string.
