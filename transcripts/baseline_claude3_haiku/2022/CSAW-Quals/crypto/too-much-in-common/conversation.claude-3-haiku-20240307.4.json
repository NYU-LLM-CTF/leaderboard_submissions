RSA is an asymmetric cryptographic algorithm that uses two different keys - a public key and a private key.\n2. The public key is composed of two numbers: the modulus (N) and the public exponent (e).\n3. The private key is also composed of two numbers: the modulus (N) and the private exponent (d).\n4. The totient function, denoted as \u03c6(N), represents the number of positive integers less than or equal to N that are relatively prime to N.\n5. The relationship between the public and private exponents is: `d * e \u2261 1 (mod \u03c6(N))`.\n\nThe challenge title \"Phi Too Much In Common\" suggests that the challenge may involve finding connections or shared factors between different RSA moduli, which could lead to the recovery of the private key.\n\nLet's try the following approach:\n\n1. Assume the server is providing us with two different RSA moduli, N1 and N2.\n2. We can then calculate the totient functions \u03c6(N1) and \u03c6(N2) using the formula: `\u03c6(N) = N - 1 - (number of prime factors of N)`.\n3. If the two moduli, N1 and N2, share a common prime factor, then their totient functions, \u03c6(N1) and \u03c6(N2), will also have a common factor.\n4. By finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \u03c6(N1) and \u03c6(N2), we can potentially recover the shared prime factor, which would then allow us to factor the moduli and find the private keys.\n5.
