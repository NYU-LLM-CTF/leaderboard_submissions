This means that an attacker could potentially use a timing attack to recover the HMAC key, as the time it takes to compare the HMACs can depend on the number of bytes that match.\n\nTo exploit this, we can write a script that attempts to recover the HMAC key by repeatedly sending ciphertexts with different HMACs and measuring the time it takes to receive a response from the server.

The `equal_bytearrays` function is used to perform this comparison.\n\nOne potential vulnerability in this implementation is that the `equal_bytearrays` function performs a byte-by-byte comparison of the two HMAC values. This means that an attacker could potentially use a timing attack to recover the HMAC key, as the time it takes to compare the HMACs can depend on the number of bytes that match.\n\nTo exploit this, we can write a script that attempts to recover the HMAC key by repeatedly sending ciphertexts with different HMACs and measuring the time it takes to receive a response from the server. By analyzing the timing differences, we may be able to recover the HMAC key and bypass the HMAC verification.\n\nHere's a sample script that demonstrates this approach:\n\n```python\nimport time\nimport hmac\nimport hashlib\nfrom Crypto.Cipher import AES\nimport base64\n\n# Replace with the actual ciphertext obtained from the server\nciphertext = b'...'\n\n# Function to recover the HMAC key\ndef recover_hmac_key():\n    key = b''\n    for i in range(32):\n        best_time = float('inf')\n        best_byte = None\n        for b in range(256):\n            hmac_guess = key + bytes([b])\n            start_time = time.time()\n            if hmac_is_valid(hmac_guess, ciphertext):\n                end_time = time.time()\n                if end_time - start_time < best_time:\n                    best_time = end_time - start_time\n                    best_byte = b\n        key += bytes([best_byte])\n        print(f\"Recovered HMAC key byte: {best_byte}\")\n    return key\n\n# Function to check the HMAC validity\ndef hmac_is_valid(hmac_guess, ciphertext):\n    try:\n        decrypt_and_verify(ciphertext, hmac_guess)\n        return True\n    except:\n        return False\n\n# Function to decrypt the ciphertext\ndef decrypt_and_verify(ct, hmac_guess):\n    pt = decrypt(ct)\n    pad, pt = verify_padding_and_unpad(pt)\n    if pt and hmac_is_valid_custom(pt, hmac_guess):\n        print(\n            \"\\nValid plaintext.

As we discussed earlier, this could potentially be a source of a padding oracle vulnerability.\n\nLet's take a closer look at the `verify_padding_and_unpad` function:\n\n```python\ndef verify_padding_and_unpad(pt):\n    pad_value = pt[-1]\n    if pad_value == 0 or pad_value > 32:\n        return False\n    else:\n        pt = pt[:(-1 * pad_value)]\n        return pad_value, pt\n```\n\nThe function checks if the padding value is between 1 and 32. If the padding is valid, it returns the padding value and the unpadded plaintext.\n\nThis implementation could potentially be vulnerable to a padding oracle attack.

The server uses the `decrypt_and_verify` function to decrypt the ciphertext and verify the HMAC:\n\n```python\ndef decrypt_and_verify(ct):\n    pt = decrypt(ct)\n    pad, pt = verify_padding_and_unpad(pt)\n    if pt and hmac_is_valid(pt):\n        print(\n            \"\\nValid plaintext.

As we discussed earlier, this could potentially be a source of a padding oracle vulnerability.\n\nLet's take a closer look at the `verify_padding_and_unpad` function:\n\n```python\ndef verify_padding_and_unpad(pt):\n    pad_value = pt[-1]\n    if pad_value == 0 or pad_value > 32:\n        return False\n    else:\n        pt = pt[:(-1 * pad_value)]\n        return pad_value, pt\n```\n\nThe function checks if the padding value is between 1 and 32.
